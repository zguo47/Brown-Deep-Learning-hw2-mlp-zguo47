    "- Select a model of choice. Can definitely be a single-layer model.\n",
    "- A brief discussion of your dataset, including links to source, motivation, and preprocessing.\n",
    "    - This can be pretty brief, since we already discuss MNIST at length. \n",
    "    - Feel free to try it on CIFAR, though this is optional!\n",
    "    - Feel free to reuse code from HW1!\n",
    "- Brief evaluation of your model. \n",
    "- Comparison against a keras model of similar implementation. \n",

    "- A brief discussion of your dataset, including links to source, motivation, and preprocessing.\n",
    "- A network architecture motivated by your specific problem. \n",
    "    - **MUST BE MULTI-LAYERED!**\n",
    "    - Discuss motivation for your design choices and hurdles you may have had to overcome. \n",
    "- Brief evaluation of your model. \n",
    "    - Include a few possible options with evaluations to motivate your final selection of model and hyperparameters. \n",
    "    - Include a few qualitative motivations or ablation studies, such as a per-class performance breakdown, visualizations, or similar. \n",
